SEO & UX choices — Learn How to Fly in 4 Weeks (one-page)
-------------------------------------------------------

SEO choices:
- Title tag: concise, includes main keyword "Learn How to Fly in 4 Weeks".
- Meta description: ~160 characters, action-oriented, includes target keywords and benefits.
- Semantic HTML: header, main, section, footer and proper H1/H2/H3 hierarchy for crawlers.
- Alt attributes on images (cover.svg and author avatar) for accessibility and image search.
- Internal anchor links (nav & CTAs) improve crawlability and single-page UX.
- File names and friendly URLs recommended when deployed (index.html at root).

UX & design decisions:
- Color palette: blues and sky gradients evoke flying and freedom; accent for CTAs to attract attention.
- Typography & hierarchy: bold H1, readable body sizes and contrast for scannability.
- Micro-interactions: hover lift on cards and buttons, smooth scrolling to anchor links, price badge.
- Mobile responsiveness: fluid grid with media queries, stack content for narrow viewports.
- Conversion flow: Awareness (hero) → Interest (benefits) → Trust (reviews/author) → Action (buy/checkout).
- Accessibility: focusable links, descriptive alt text, form labels, ARIA attributes on navigation & lists.
